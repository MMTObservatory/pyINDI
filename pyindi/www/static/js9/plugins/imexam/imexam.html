<h3>JS9 Imexam Plugins</h3>

These tasks perform various types of image analysis using a rectangular box
surrounding the selected region. That is, the actual region shape is ignored
and the analysis reflects a rectangular section of image pixels. The selected
section can be rotated for box, ellipse, and line regions. For a line region,
the width is the length of the line, while the height is set to  the value of
the JS9.globalOpts.imexamLineHeight parameter (default is 1).

<h3>Region Statistics</h3>

A rectangular box of image pixels is selected and some statistical
values are computed from the data.

<blockquote>
    <h4>Notes</h4>

    <ul>
     <li><b>Totcounts and bscounts</b>
     <p>
            Totcounts are the total counts in the box region, while bscounts
	    has the calculated background (see below) subtracted from the total.

     <li><b>Background and Noise</b>
     <p>
	    The background and noise are obtained from the outer 4 pixel-wide
	    perimeter of the selected region.  The background value is the median 
	    value of this area and the noise value is the RMS.
     </li>
     <li><b>Centroid</b>
     <p>
	    The centroid is obtained by locating the brightest 9 pixel box and 
	    computing the centroid of the background subtracted data about this point.
     </li>
     <li><b>FWHM</b>
     <p>
	    The FWHM is estimated from the image moments about the centroid, assuming 
	    a Gaussian distribution.
     </li>
     </ul>

<h3>X and Y Projection Plot</h3>

A rectangular box of image pixels is selected and the projection along
the region's X (width) or Y (height) axis is plotted.  The sum,
average, or median of the projected pixels may be selected.

<p>
<a name="r_proj"></a>
<h3>Radial Profile</h3>

A rectangular box of image pixels is selected and the pixels values
are plotted against their respective radii.  A Gaussian is fit to the
radial profile data and the result is also plotted.  The fitted
results of the 4 parameter fit are displayed with the plot.

<p>
The center pixel from which the radii are computed is determined from the
background subtracted centroid taken about the brightest 9 pixels in the data
(same centroid as is displayed in the region stats plugin).

<h3>Pixel Value Histogram</h3>

A rectangular box of image pixels is selected and a histogram of the
values is plotted. The selected pixels are binned into 250 bins
between the minimum and maximum value found in the selected region.

<p>
<a name="enener"></a>
<h3>Encircled Energy</h3>

A rectangular box of image pixels is selected and background subtracted.  The 
analysis radius is determined from the region as follows:

    <ul>
     <li><b>circle</b>: region radius</li>
     <li><b>annulus</b>: max annulus radius</li>
     <li><b>box</b>: half the average height an width</li>
     <li><b>ellipse</b>: average axis radius</li>
     <li><b>polygon</b>: half the average of the height and width of polygon bounding box</li>
    </ul>

The values within the analysis radius are binned in 1 pixel radial bins.  The
bins are normalized by the sum of all pixels and the result is plotted.

<p>
The background is obtained as the median from the outer 4 pixel wide perimeter of the
selected region.

<p>
The center pixel from which the encircled energy is computed is determined from
the background subtracted centroid taken about the brightest 9 pixels in the
data (same centroid as is displayed in the region stats plugin).

<p>
The 50 and 80 percent encircled energy points are displayed over the plot.

<h3>3d Surface Plot</h3>

A rectangular box of image pixels is selected and plotted as a surface.
