<h3>JS9 Panner</h3>

<p>
The Panner plugin will displays the full image along with a viewport
rectangle showing the currently displayed image section in the primary
image window. The viewport can be moved around in order to pan to
different locations in the primary image. The panner also has command
button options to zoom the viewport itself. (This makes the viewport
rectangle larger at the expense of displaying only a section of the
full image. It is useful for panning in a very large image.)

<p>
The WCS orientation (North and East) are shown on the display.
You can turn off direction display by changing the value of the
<b>JS9.globalOpts.pannerDirections</b> property, either by using the
<b>Preferences</b> plugin or, for site-wide configuration, by changing
the value in the <b>js9prefs.js</b> file.
