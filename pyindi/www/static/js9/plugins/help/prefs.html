<h3>JS9 User Preferences</h3>

<p>
The JS9 preferences plugin allows you to set JS9 user preferences for
JS9-enabled Web pages in the current domain. By and large, these are
the same preferences that can be found in the JS9 site preferences
file (js9Prefs.json), and of course you can set defaults in that file.
However, the preferences plugin allows you to set these preferences in
cases where you do not have access to this file, e.g. public sites
such as js9.si.edu.

<p> Due to cross-browser security limitations, preferences are
browser-specific: your Firefox preferences will be maintained
separately from your Chrome and Safari preferences.

<p>
The following types of user preferences can be set:
<ul>
<li><b>images:</b> colormap, contrast, scale, etc. for all newly displayed images
<li><b>regions:</b> region parameters (radius, width, height, etc) for all newly created regions
<li><b>fits:</b> a list of binary table extensions to look for in a drag/drop operation, size of image to extract
<li><b>displays:</b> settings applied to each JS9 display, these currently consist of mouse/touch actions (see the Mouse Touch plugin for more info)
</ul>

<p>
You can apply your preference choices to the current session using the
<b>Apply</b> button. To apply and save these preferences for future
sessions, use the <b>Save</b> button. The <b>Show Saved</b> and
<b>Delete Saved</b> buttons allow you to view and clear the currently
saved values, respectively.
