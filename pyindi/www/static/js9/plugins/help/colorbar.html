<h3>JS9 Colorbar</h3>

The JS9 <b>Colorbar</b> displays the mapping of colors to pixel values
for the currently displayed image. The choice of colormap and scale
(including scale min and max values) determines the initial
distribution of colors. Moving the mouse to changing the contrast/bias
affects the mapping by expanding/compressing (contrast) and shifting
(bias) the colormap so that it covers different ranges of image values.

<p>
If you change scales (e.g., from linear to log), the colormap at first
might not appear to change. However, note that the numeric labels have
changed.  This shows you how colors are now associated with a different
range of pixel values. The linear scale displays an evenly distributed
range of image values, but the log scale does not: the distribution is
a log(base10) distribution.

<p>
When printing an image using the <b>File->print</b> menu option, if a
colorbar is active on the page, it will be placed beneath the image.
