<h3>Create Colormaps</h3>

<p>
The <b>Colormaps</b> plugin allows you to create compatible colormaps
using a base color or an existing colormap. You can choose
the number of colormaps to create, the algorithm used to create the
new colormaps, and whether to apply them to existing images.

<p>
In order to give more control over colormap creation, the plugin
allows you to specify a number of slices into which the 360
degree colorwheel will be divided, starting with the base color.
The n created colormaps are then assigned to the first n slices of
the colorwheel. For example, if you choose to create three slices and
three colormaps, each colormap will be separated from the others by
120 degrees (1/3 of the colorwheel). If you create six slices and three
colormaps, each colormap will be separated by 60 degrees (1/6 of the
colorwheel), starting from the base color.

<p>
The algorithms for generating new colormaps are:
<ul>
<li><b>equidistant</b>: colormaps are created so that they are equidistant around the colorwheel. For example, when creating three colormaps from three slices, starting with a red base, the three colors used for the colormaps will be at 0, 120, and 240 degrees around the colorwheel (i.e. red, green, and blue).
<li><b>analogous</b>: create groups of colors around the colorwheel (i.e., generally closer than equidistant). For example, red, orange, and red-orange are analogous colors. Choose three or more colormaps.
</ul>
There are many, many articles on the net describing colors and their
compatibility. Just search for "colorwheel", "color theory", or
"compatible colors", etc.

<p>
When the color picker is used to select a base color, new colors are
chosen from this base color to generate monochromatic colormaps. When an
existing colormap is used, each inflection point of the colormap generates
new colors, which then are combined into new colormaps.

<p>
By default, the color picker is the HTML5 color picker implemented
within the browser. These internal color pickers generally have
several nice ways to choose a color.  If the browser does not support
an internal color picker (e.g. Safari 11, even though the Mac OSX
supports a great color picker!), a simplified color picker is used
instead.  Note that the HTML5 color picker is a bit quirky: it remains
displayed when the page is unloaded or reloaded, even though it
becomes detached from the new page. You must always exit the HTML5
color picker by clicking its exit button.

<p>
The generated colormaps are added to the <b>Color</b> menu in the <b>more colormaps ...</b> submenu. If you use the color picker to choose a base color, the colormaps are named "[id]_1", [id]_2", etc., where [id] is the id of the JS9 display (e.g. "JS9"). If you use an existing colormap, the new colormaps are called "[cname]_1", [cname]_2", etc., where [cname] is the name of the original colormap.

<p>
Colormaps can be assigned to images by clicking the button to the left
of the image name. The colormap assignments are made in stacking
order, which you can change by dragging an image into the appropriate
place on the stack.

<p>
Note that the parameters of each colormap plugin instance can be
controlled independently, and that each instance allows you to assign
colormaps to any image, regardless of its parent display.  This means,
for example, that you can load three images into separate displays and
change their colormaps simultaneously.
