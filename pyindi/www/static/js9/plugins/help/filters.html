<h3>JS9 Image Filters</h3>

The <b>Image Filter</b> plugin allows you to apply image processing
techniques directly to the displayed image without changing the
underlying raw data. The web has an overwhelming
amount of information about image processing.  A good technical
article concerning the use of image filters with Javascript and the
HTML5 canvas is available at:
<a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/imagefilters/" target="_blank">

</a>

<p>
Note that the standard JS9 colormaps, scale, contrast and bias
selections are applied to the raw data to regenerate the RGB
image. Thus, if you use an image processing technique and then change
colormap, contrast, bias, or scale, you will undo the applied image
processing. This is a good way to reset the displayed image.

<p>
Several image processing filters and convolutions are available, many of
which allow you to adjust a parameter using either a slider or by
typing a value into the text box:
<ul>
<li><b>blur(val):</b> blur the image using a pseudo-Gaussian convolution
<li><b>brighten(val):</b> add constant value to each pixel to change the brightness
<li><b>darken(val):</b> darken by applying the kernel
[ 0, 0, 0, 0, val, 0, 0, 0, 0],
<li><b>duotone(0|1|2):</b> remove a color by setting it to
the average of the other two, e.g. red=(green+blue)/2, where the input
values are: 0 = red, 1 = green, 2 = blue
<li><b>edge():</b> detect edges using the kernel
[ -1, -1, -1, -1, 8, -1, -1, -1, -1 ]
<li><b>emboss(val):</b> produce embossing effect using the kernel
[-18, -9, 9, -9, 100 - val, 9, 0, 9, 18 ]
<li><b>gamma(val):</b> apply the nonlinear gamma operation, used to code and 
decode luminance values in video or still image systems: 
out = pow(in, val)
<li><b>invert():</b> the RGB channels of the image are inverted
<li><b>lighten(val):</b> lighten the image by applying the kernel
[ 0, 0, 0, 0, val, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
<li><b>luminance():</b>convert to greyscale using the CIE luminance:
0.2126*r + 0.7152*g + 0.0722*b
[255-r, 255-g, 255-b, a]
<li><b>median():</b> noise reduction technique that replaces each pixel with
the median of neighboring pixels
<li><b>noise(val):</b> add random noise: 
pixel =  pixel + Math.floor((Math.random()*(val)
<li><b>pixelate(val):</b>make image look coarser by creating a square tiling
effect of the specified size
<li><b>scatter(val):</b> scatters the colors of a pixel in its
neighborhood, akin to viewing through brittle cracked glass
<li><b>sepia(val):</b> image takes on shades of brown, like an antique
photograph
<li><b>sharpen(val):</b> sharpen the image using the kernel
[ 0, -3, 0, -3, val, -3, 0, -3, 0 ]
<li><b>sobel():</b> use the Sobel operator to create an image that
emphasizes the edges
<li><b>solarize(val):</b> which image is wholly or partially reversed in
tone. Dark areas appear light or light areas appear dark.
</ul>

<p>
Filters are cumulative: if you apply a filter and then apply a second filter,
the latter changes the current RGB color values that were  modified by the
first filter.

<p>
You can undo the effects of the current filter by clicking the
<b>undo [filter]</b> button. This reverts the image to the colors used
in the previous filter. The <b>undo</b> operation is applied to the
current filter, allowing you to unwind the filters back to the
original image colors. You can, of course, unset all filters at once
by changing the colormap, contrast, bias, or scale.
