<h3>JS9 Pan/Zoom Controls</h3>

<p>
The <b>Pan/Zoom Controls</b> plugin allows you to pan to an image location
that can be specified using image, physical, or WCS coordinates.

<p>
The plugin initially displays the current pan location using the
current globally configured WCS system and units. Choose a different
system and/or units via the WCS system and WCS units menus and the
current pan position will be updated appropriately. Then enter a new
position in the position text boxes and click the <b>Pan to &rarr;</b>
button to pan the image.

<p>
The plugin also offers menus to pan, zoom, flip, and rotate the image
by 90 degree increments, along with a text box to rotate by an
arbitrary angle in degrees.  Note that arbitrary rotation is performed
in terms of an absolute angle: if you rotate by 20 degrees and then do
it again, there is no change. Also, setting the rotation to 0 sets the
angle to 0.  Flipping and rot90, however, are relative to the current
state of the display.

<p>
The <b>Flip</b> menu's <b>reset</b> option unsets x and/or y
flips. The <b>Rotate</b> menu's <b>reset</b> option resets both the rot90 and
rotation angle, as does specifying <b>reset</b> in the rotation text box.
The <b>Rotate</b> menu's <b>reset flip/rot90/rotate</b> option resets flip, rot90, and rotate.
