<h3>JS9 Sync Images</h3>

<p>
Synchronize two or more images, so that when an operation is performed
on one image, it also is performed on the other(s). For example, when
the colormap or scale is changed on an image, it also is changed on
the sync'ed images. Or, when a region is created, moved, resized, or
removed on an image, the same happens on the sync'ed images. You also
can synchronize once only.

<p>
The plugin displays a list of images that can be sync'ed with the
current image, as well as a list of operations that can be sync'ed,
including "colormap", "contrast/bias", "flip", "pan", "regions",
"rot90", "scale", "wcs sys/units", and "zoom". Choose one or more
images to sync and one or more operations for sync'ing and then
click <b>Sync Repeatedly"</b> or <b>Sync Once</b>. The first routine
calls <b>JS9.SyncImages()</b> while the second calls <b>JS9.CopyParams()</b>
to perform repeated or single synchronizing, respectively. You also can
<b>Unsync</b> operations that previously had been set up for repeated
synchronization.

<p>
Upon initialization, the displayed images and ops checkboxes will show
both images and operations sync'ed with the currently displayed
image. When you execute a new repeated synchronization, the displayed
checkboxes will be updated appropriately.  Note that if you
synchronize once only, the display will not reflect this one-time
action (but will continue to reflect repeated synchronizations, if
any). This makes it clear which images and ops are repeatedly sync'ed
and thus makes it easier to unsync operations.

<p>
The following options are available:
<ul>
<li><b>reciprocal sync </b>: images sync one another (i.e., changes go both ways)
<li><b>sync using wcs</b>: use wcs header params to sync (e.g. for pan), where available
</ul>
