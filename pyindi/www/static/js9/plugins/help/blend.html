<h3>JS9 Image Blending</h3>

<p>
The <b>Image Blending</b> plugin allows you to combine selected images
using a specified blend mode and optional opacity. Blend modes are
different ways in which the colors of individual pixels are
combined between a source and background image. For example,
the <b>multiply</b> mode multiplies the color value of the source
pixel by the color value of the background pixel and uses the
resulting (scaled) value for the color:
<pre>
    x = a * b
</pre>
Multiplying white (value 1) by any other color results in the latter
color being used. Multiplying black (value 0) by any other color
results in black being used. Thus, <b>multiply</b> makes whites
transparent but otherwise darkens the image.

<p>
One of the most useful blend modes for astronomy is <b>screen</b>, which is
the opposite of <b>multiply</b>: white pixels are made opaque, black pixels
become transparent, and other pixels are lightened. The blend algorithm
multiplies inverses and takes the inverse of the result:
<pre>
    x = 1 − ((1 − a) × (1 − b))
</pre>

<p>
Standard blend modes supported by modern Web browsers are documented in
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/" target="blank">
W3C Compositing and Blending</a>, which includes algorithms and examples
for each mode.

<p>
The <b>Image Blending</b> plugin allows you to toggle global image blending
on and off, so that you can switch between blending and the ordinary display
of a single image. By default, when the plugin is displayed, blending is 
turned on.

<p>
Each image loaded into the display will be shown in a stack.
The currently active image will be displayed with a green border.
This is the image that responds to contrast/bias changes, region
creation, etc.  It also is the image on which browser-based analysis
and server-based analysis is performed. You can click on any image
in the stack to make it the current image.

<p>
If you have two or more observations of the same object displayed, you
probably will want to align them by WCS coordinates. This can be done by
utilizing the <b>WCS->reproject</b> menu option, which uses the WCS of one
image to reproject the other into a new raw data layer.

<p>
Once two or more images are aligned, you can change the colormap,
contrast/bias and scaling of each of them separately and then combine
them into a single display. This is done by clicking the <b>blend
using</b> button to add this image to the blend list, and the choosing
its blend mode and optional opacity. You can continue to change the
colormap, scale, contrast/bias, etc. of the current image even after
blending has been turned on.

<p>
Note that some, but not all, blend modes are commutative. In particular,
the <b>non-separable</b> blend modes (<b>hue</b>, <b>saturation</b>, 
<b>color</b>, and <b>luminosity</b>) are all order-dependent.  In such
cases, you can change the stacking order simply by dragging an image
into the appropriate place on the stack.
