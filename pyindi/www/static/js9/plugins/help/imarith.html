<h3>JS9 Image Arithmetic</h3>

<p>
The <b>Image Arithmetic</b> plugin performs basic arithmetic
operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, minimum,
maximum) between the currently displayed image and either another
image or a constant real value.

<p>
To start, choose an arithmetic <b>operation</b> from the first menu.
Next use the second menu to choose either a <b>real value</b> or another
<b>image</b> as the second operand. In the former case, the constant value
you enter into the text box will be applied to each pixel in the
image. In the latter case, the operation is performed between the
corresponding pixels in the two images.

<p>
Click the <b>Run</b> button to perform the arithmetic operation.  A
new raw data layer called "imarith" will be created containing the
results of the operation. Successive runs are cumulative, so that you
can build up a more complex operation from simple ones.

<p>
Click the <b>Reset</b> button to delete the "imarith" raw data layer,
which will allow you to start afresh.

<p>
Note that the two images must have the same dimensions. We might be
able to remove this restriction in the future, although it is
unclear how one lines up images of different dimensions.
