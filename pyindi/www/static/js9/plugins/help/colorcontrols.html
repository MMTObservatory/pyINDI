<h3>Color Controls</h3>

<p>
The <b>Color Controls</b> plugin provides a number of ways to set colors
on an image:
<ul>
<li> use the <b>Top cmaps</b> and <b>Other cmaps</b> menus to change
the colormap
<li> use the <b>Create cmaps</b> button to toggle the
<b>Create Colormaps</b> plugin, allowing you to
create new colormaps
<li> use the <b>Image filters</b> button to toggle the <b>Image Filters</b>
plugin and apply image processing techniques to the displayed image
<li> use the <b>Contrast/bias</b> text boxes to change the contrast and bias
<li> use the <b>Opacity</b> options to set the opacity in various ways
</ul>

<p>
Opacity can be set in various ways, depending on the option chosen in the
<b>mode</b> menu:

<p>
When <b>default</b> is selected, the opacity of each pixel is set to the
default value in the first text box (which should be between 0 and 1). The
default value is also used in the <b>pixels</b> option.

<p>
When <b>floor &le;</b> is selected, the opacity in the first text box
is applied to image pixels whose value is less than or equal to the
specified floor value in the last text box. For image values greater than
this floor value, the <b>default</b> opacity is applied.

<p>
When <b>opacity</b> is selected, a menu of <b>opacity image files</b> is
displayed. These opacity images must have the same dimensions as the
displayed image. A pixel value in the opacity image specifies the
opacity of the corresponding image pixel (and therefore should take on
values between 0 and 1).

<p>
For <b>mask</b> mode, if the value of a pixel in the image is less than
or equal to zero, the opacity of the displayed pixel is set to the
<b>opacity</b> value in the text box. Otherwise, the opacity is set to
the <b>global</b> opacity. Thus, for example, if the <b>opacity</b> in
the first text box is set to 0, this mode will display only the image
pixels with corresponding non-zero mask values, i.e., image pixels
"covered" by a mask.

<p>
When <b>overlay</b> is selected, a menu of <b>overlay files</b> is
displayed. These "overlay mask" images must have the same dimensions
as the displayed image. If a mask pixel has a non-zero alpha value (in
its own display frame), its color is blended with the image pixel
using <b>source-atop</b> composition.  Otherwise, the image pixel
color alone is used in the display. This is one way you can display a
mask overlay on top of an image.  A static colormap is usually used in
conjunction with an overlay mask, since pixel values not explicitly
assigned a color are transparent.  Note that, when blending a mask and
image pixel, the global opacity and the individual pixel opacity of
the mask are multiplied to get each final pixel opacity.
