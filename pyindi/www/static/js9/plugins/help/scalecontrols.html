<h3>Scale Controls</h3>

<p>
The JS9/DS9 scaling algorithms convert image pixel values to RGB
values, as described in the DS9
documentation <a href="http://ds9.si.edu/doc/ref/how.html" target="_blank">
"How It Works"</a>. Scaling utilizes low and high
clipping values when mapping the data to RGB. These limits are
initially taken to be the high and low data values, which obviously
can be wasteful of the color distribution if a few low or high values
are far away from the bulk of the data values.

<p>
The <b>Scale Controls</b> plugin therefore provides a number of ways to
set the low and high clipping limits:
<ul>
<li> use the <b>Limits</b> menu to choose data min/max, IRAF zscale z1/z2 or IRAF zscale z1/max
<li> select a portion of the <b>Pixel Distribution</b> plot
<li> change the <b>Low</b> and/or <b>High</b> limits directly using the text boxes
</ul>
The <b>Pixel Distribution</b> plots a histogram of the distribution of
pixel values (binned into 512 bins). The current low and high clipping
values are shown as red and green carets, respectively, at the bottom
of the plot.  Moving the mouse over the plot will show the pixel
value, i.e. the x coordinate.

<p>
You can select a region of the distribution by pressing the mouse and
moving it left or right. When the mouse is released, the selected low
and high pixel values will be used as the new clipping values.
(Selection does not work for mouse-less iPads, but you still
can view the distribution values and input your chosen limits into
the <b>Low</b> and/or <b>High</b> text boxes.)

<p>
The <b>IRAF zscale</b> algorithm is described on the
<a href="http://iraf.noao.edu/" target="_blank">IRAF</a> DISPLAY task help page,
which is reproduced below. Note that zscale parameters can be changed using the
the JS9 <b>Preferences</b> plugin.
<p>
The zscale algorithm is designed to display the  image  values  near
the  median  image  value  without  the  time  consuming  process of
computing a full image histogram.  This is particularly  useful  for
astronomical  images  which  generally  have a very peaked histogram
corresponding to  the  background  sky  in  direct  imaging  or  the
continuum in a two dimensional spectrum.
<p>
The  sample  of pixels, specified by values greater than zero in the
sample mask zmask or by an  image  section,  is  selected  up  to  a
maximum  of nsample pixels.  If a bad pixel mask is specified by the
bpmask parameter then any pixels with mask values which are  greater
than  zero  are not counted in the sample.  Only the first pixels up
to the limit are selected where the order is by line beginning  from
the  first line.  If no mask is specified then a grid of pixels with
even spacing along lines and columns that  make  up  a  number  less
than or equal to the maximum sample size is used.
<p>
If  a  contrast of zero is specified (or the zrange flag is used and
the image does not have a  valid  minimum/maximum  value)  then  the
minimum  and maximum of the sample is used for the intensity mapping
range.
<p>
If the contrast  is  not  zero  the  sample  pixels  are  ranked  in
brightness  to  form  the  function  I(i) where i is the rank of the
pixel and I is its value.  Generally the midpoint of  this  function
(the  median) is very near the peak of the image histogram and there
is a well defined slope about the midpoint which is related  to  the
width  of the histogram.  At the ends of the I(i) function there are
a few very bright and dark pixels due to objects and defects in  the
field.   To  determine  the  slope  a  linear  function  is fit with
iterative rejection;
<pre>
    I(i) = intercept + slope * (i - midpoint)
</pre>
If more than half of the points are rejected then there is  no  well
defined  slope  and  the full range of the sample defines z1 and z2.
Otherwise the endpoints of the linear function  are  used  (provided
they are within the original range of the sample):
<pre>
    z1 = I(midpoint) + (slope / contrast) * (1 - midpoint)
    z2 = I(midpoint) + (slope / contrast) * (npoints - midpoint)
</pre>
As  can  be  seen,  the parameter contrast may be used to adjust the
contrast produced by this algorithm.
