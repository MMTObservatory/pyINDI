<b>Unresolved Issues:</b>

<ol>

<li><b>Desktop app (July 9, 2019 : unresolved)</b>
<p>
The <a href="https://electronjs.org/" target="_blank">Electron.js</a>-based
JS9 desktop app has some limitations when a second instance is started up.
The most obvious concerns the <b>Preferences</b> plugin, which uses
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage"
target="_blank">localStorage</a> to save parameters between sessions.
Unfortunately, <a href="https://electronjs.org/" target="_blank">
Electron.js</a> apps do not properly return localStorage values for
the second (and subsequent) instance. We therefore have disabled the ability
to load and store preferences via localStorage in all but the first
running instance of the JS9 app.

<li><b>Chrome (January 20, 2019 : unresolved)</b>
<p>
Chrome's memory restrictions remain more stringent than those of
Firefox or Safari. On a Macbook Pro, it is possible to reproject a
4096x4096 32-bit image in Firefox and Safari, whereas Chrome gets the
"snap" error for 32-bit images larger than approximately 3800x3800.
We will continue to try to reduce memory usage, while hoping for less
restrictive limits (or even full support for unlimited memory via mmap()).

<li><b>Linux platforms using Firefox (February 20, 2018 : unresolved)</b>
<p>
One of the simplest ways to use JS9 locally is by means of the file://
URL scheme, e.g., point your browser to file:///home/me/js9/js9basics.html.
<p>
On Linux, although this works in Firefox for files in the web page's
domain, it does not work for files outside the domain:
<pre>
    JS9.Load("foo.fits")         # works
    JS9.Load("fits/foo.fits")    # works
    JS9.Load("../foo.fits")      # does not work
</pre>
Firefox does appear to load files outside the web domain properly on a Mac.
<p>

<li><b>Webkit (Safari and Chrome) (December 3, 2015 : unresolved)</b>
<p>
Webkit browsers such as Safari and Chrome implement resizeable divs in
an unintuitive way, which required several hacks in order to allow us
to resize the JS9 display on the fly.  The resizeable (enclosing) div
must be larger than the JS9 display canvas, or else the resize handle
cannot be seen. As a result, the resize handle juts out from the
JS9 display in an unappealing way.  Also, the resize operation can only
increase the size of the display, not decrease it. To work around this,
you can first decrease the display size using the View menu, which
sets a new minimum size for GUI-based resize.  Finally, the cursor is
not changed to a resize cursor. I couldn't figure out how to work
around this in a fool-proof way.  We hope Webkit will implement more
intuitive behavior in the near future.

<li><b>All platforms (June 13, 2014 : unresolved)</b>
<p>
When resizing a box region in one direction only (i.e., width or
height), the width of the region's border will be different in each
direction.  This is due to the underlying graphics algorithm used to
resize the region, which changes the scale factor in each direction
individually and ties the border width to that scale factor. We will
fix this in a future release.

<li><b>Safari Mobile platforms (April 9, 2015 : unresolved)</b>
<p>
A maximum image size is enforced by Apple on Safari mobile devices.
(See https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4975106 for a discussion.)
If you want your JS9 PNG representation files to display on iPhones
and iPads, they should be restricted to a size of less than
approximately 1900x1900, depending on the size of the FITS header. So
a PNG file of size 1024x1024 should be fine, while a file of size
2048x2048 certainly will be too large.

</ol>

<p>
<b>Resolved Issues:</b>

<ol>
<li><b>Safari (October 4, 2016 : resolved)</b>
<p>
On Mac OSX, if the Terminal running the js9 messaging script is
located in a different Space (i.e. desktop) from the Safari browser
with which it is communicating, the transfer of results from the
browser to the script can be delayed up to several seconds. It does
not happen all the time and it does not happen if the two applications
share the same Space. The data transfer also will resume immediately
if you switch to the Space containing the browser. The obvious
work-around is to make sure that the Terminal and browser share the
same Space.
<p>
The problems appears to have gone away with MacOS 10.14 (Mojave).

<li><b>All platforms, especially Chrome (June 21, 2014 : resolved)</b>
<p>
Available memory can be a problem when loading very large gzip'ed FITS
files, especially in 32-bit Chrome. JS9 currently reads the entire
FITS file or gzip'ed file and inflates parts as needed. It can process
files up to approx. 200Mb in size before Chrome runs out of heap
space.  Note that Chrome often will load an ungzip'ed FITS file in
cases where the gzip'ed file fails (though there still are upper
limits on the total space available).  We hope that the 64-bit version
of Chrome (in early Canary release as of 7/1/2014) will alleviate
these problems. Otherwise, we will take a more drastic approach to
memory management within JS9 (at the expense of speed).
<p>
The 64-bit Chrome can make use of 2Gb of memory.

<li><b>All platforms using Chrome and Firefox (April 23, 2020 : resolved)</b>
<p>
One of the simplest ways to use JS9 locally is by means of the file://
URL scheme, e.g., point your browser to file:///home/me/js9/js9basics.html.
<p>
This does not work in Google Chrome because Chrome does not permit a
local HTML file to read other local files. You can read a relatively
emotional argument about this restriction at:
<pre>
    https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=37586
</pre>
<p>
The workaround is to start Chrome with the 
--allow-file-access-from-files switch. On Linux:
<pre>
    chrome --allow-file-access-from-files
</pre>
On a Mac:
<pre>
    open /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --args --allow-file-access-from-files
</pre>
It also does not work on Firefox starting with version 68. See:
<pre>
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors/CORSRequestNotHttp
</pre>
for details. The workaround (as discussed in that security page) is to
turn off the <b>privacy.file_unique_origin</b> preference in
<b>about:config</b>.
<p>

<li><b>All platforms (May 20, 2013: resolved)</b>
<p>
If the "load image" command is part of a group of commands passed to
the js9 script, a race condition can occur when subsequent commands
are executed before the image is fully loaded. To avoid this problem,
images should be loaded in a separate js9 command and the load status
checked for completion before proceeding to manipulate the image.  See
the <b>js9load</b> script for details (or just use the script itself
to load images). (Technical details: images are loaded asynchronously,
so that other parts of the web page are available during the load
process. A synchronous load could freeze the web page while
loading. To avoid this situation, external processes should use the
"status load" command to check for a completed load before sending
further processing commands).
