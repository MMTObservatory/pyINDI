<h3>Adding JS9 to Your Web Page</h3>
<p>
The sample js9basics.html file shows how to add JS9 to a web page by
assigning JS9 CSS classes to "div" elements.  The js9multi.html web
page goes further by showing how multiple instances of JS9 can be
added using unique IDs.

<p>
To start, a few JavaScript and CSS files must be loaded into the web
page.  Ordinarily this is done in the page's header, which typically
will look something like this:
<pre>
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"&gt;
  &lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=Edge;chrome=1" &gt; 
  &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" &gt;
  &lt;link type="image/x-icon" rel="shortcut icon" href="./favicon.ico"&gt;
  &lt;link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="js9support.css"&gt;
  &lt;link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="js9.css"&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="js9prefs.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="js9support.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="js9.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="js9plugins.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
</pre>
The js9prefs.js file (and deprecated js9Prefs.json file) is optional.
It contains a JS9Prefs object that holds various default settings for
JS9, e.g. default colormap and scale for image display.  Feel free to
edit this file to set up your own site-specific parameters. See
<a href="./preferences.html">JS9 Site Preferences</a> for a
description of the available parameters.

<p>
Order is important: The js9prefs.js file must be loaded first. The
js9support.min.js must be loaded before you load js9.min.js. You must
load the plugin files after you load js9.min.js.  You can simply copy
the order of files as specified in the JS9 demo files.

<p>
You can, of course, arrange to have your web server gzip the javascript
files, using browser-based capabilities to ungzip them automatically. The
JS9 web site serves <b>pre-compressed content</b>, as described in the
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_deflate.html">
Apache Module mod_deflate</a> page.

<p>
The text file <b>js9support.txt</b> is a list of the files contained
in js9support.css, js9support.js, js9support.min,js, and js9plugins.js.

<p>
The js9support.min.js file contains a number of required third-party
software modules, including jQuery, fabric.js (2D graphics), flot (for
plotting), dhtmlwindow (for light windows), etc. It is separated from
js9.min.js to optimize file caching. Although JS9 <b>will not run</b>
properly without these third-party modules, you are free to load them
manually, i.e., without loading js9support.min.js itself. A manual
load is useful in cases where you want a different version of one of
the third-party modules (e.g., js9support.min.js loads jQuery 1.12.2,
but you need to utilize jQuery 1.11.3). In such a case, we still
recommend creating a single file to hold third-party modules, in order
to minimize load latency.

<p>
JS9 <b>will run</b> without the js9plugins.js file, but with much
restricted functionality.  In particular, core plugins such as
blending, blinking, colorbar, data cube, magnifier, panner, etc. are
loaded from this file, as are analysis plugins such as encircled
energy, radial projection, region statistics, and 3D plot.  Note that
the regions and mouse/touch core plugins are always loaded from within
js9.min.js itself, since they are essential to almost all JS9
functionality.

<p>
All of these Javascript plugin files are contained in the plugins
subdirectory, so you can load them individually, e.g.:
<pre>
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="js9prefs.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="js9support.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="js9.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="plugins/core/menubar.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="plugins/core/info.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
will load only the menubar and info display plugins.

<p>
During startup, JS9 will asynchronously load the <b>js9worker.js</b>
file in order to create a worker process. It also will load either
the <b>astroem.js</b> file or the <b>astroemw.js</b>
and <b>astroemw.wasm</b> files, depending on whether
<a href="http://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> is supported on your browser.

<p>
The main JS9 display as well as JS9 plugins are placed on a web page
by assigning JS9 classes to ordinary "div" elements. The two important
JS9 classes are:
<ul>
<li><b>JS9:</b> this class will display the main JS9 image window
<li><b>JS9Menubar:</b> this class will display the JS9 menubar
</ul>
Thus, for example, to place a menubar on top of a JS9 display, use:
<pre>
  &lt;div class="JS9Menubar"&gt;
  &lt;div class="JS9"&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Among the many JS9 plugins that you can add to your webpage are:
<ul>
<li><b>Archives & Catalogs</b>: access to external archives and catalogs
<li><b>Bin/Filter/Section</b>: support for extracting sections from images
<li><b>Blending</b>: blend images using standard composite techniques
<li><b>Blinking</b>: blink two or more images
<li><b>Colormaps</b>: create colormaps
<li><b>Console:</b> display a console window for executing commands
<li><b>Contours</b>: create contour maps
<li><b>Data Cube</b>: process 3D FITS data cubes
<li><b>Extensions</b>: view FITS extensions
<li><b>Info:</b> display position, value, and other information as mouse moves
<li><b>Keyboard Actions</b>: configure keyboard actions
<li><b>Magnifier:</b> display a magnifier window centered on the mouse position
<li><b>Mouse/Touch</b>: configure mouse/touch actions
<li><b>Panner:</b> display a panner window of the whole image
<li><b>Pixel Table</b>: display a pixel value table centered on the mouse position
<li><b>Preferences</b>: configure JS9 preferences
</ul>
<p>
Any of these can be added to a web page by specifying a div element with the
appropriate class:
<pre>
    &lt;div class="JS9Menubar"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="JS9Toolbar"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="JS9"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div style="margin-top: 2px;"&gt;
    &lt;div class="JS9Colorbar"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<p>
NB: all of these plugins can also be displayed at any time as light
windows, using the appropriate <b>View</b> menu options. Light windows
can moved around on the page and dismissed when no longer needed. Also
note that if a plugin is declared statically in a page, it will not be
made available in the <b>View</b> menu.

<p>
Placement of JS9 div elements should follow standard web page rules
and constraints.  This means that div elements can be placed in any
order to create different graphical views. For example, the
js9basics.html page places the menubar above the image display, in
keeping with the traditional layout of DS9. The entire JS9 construct
is placed in a data cell of a table, next to a data cell containing
data URLs.

<p>
The JS9 display has a default width and height of 512x512. You can
change this by adding <b>data-width</b> and <b>data-height</b>
attributes to the div. For example, to create a display of size 256x256, use:
<pre>
  &lt;div class="JS9" data-width="256px" data-height="256px"&gt;
</pre>
The <b>data-width</b> and <b>data-height</b> attributes can be applied
to the other JS9 divs (which can be especially useful for the menubar).
Thus, for example, if you shorten the width of the Js9 display, you might
also want to shorten the width of the menubar:
<pre>
  &lt;div class="JS9Menubar" data-width="256px" data-height="48px"&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Multiple instances of JS9 (including the main JS9 display element
and secondary plugins elements) can be added to a single web page. This
is done by specifying multiple sets of JS9 elements. Each main JS9 display
element should have a unique HTML <b>id</b> associated with it:
<pre>
   &lt;div class="JS9" id="JS9"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;div class="JS9" id="myJS9"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<p>
To connect a JS9 plugin element to a given JS9 display element, you
can either use an HTML <b>id</b> that obeys certain rules, or you can
use an HTML data attribute <b>data-js9id</b>, as described below.

<p>
To connect a JS9 display to one or more JS9 plugins using an
HTML <b>id</b> attribute, the plugin ids should be specified as follows:
<ul>
<li> start with a unique ID name, e.g. "myJS9" that matches the main JS9 id
<li> follow with an optional dash or underscore
<li> finish with the type of JS9 plugin, e.g. "Menubar", "Panner", "Magnifier" "Info", "3dPlot", "RegionStats", etc.
</ul>
For example:
<pre>
    &lt;div class="JS9Menubar" id="myJS9Menubar"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="JS9" id="myJS9"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="JS9Colorbar" id="myJS9Colorbar"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="ImExamRegionStats" id="myJS9RegionStats"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
Note that the type of plugin is the simple name of the plugin, without the class prefix, e.g., "RegionStats" instead of "ImExamRegionStats". (Esoteric note: for
non-JS9 class plugins, you can prefix the class to avoid name collisions.)

<p>
To connect a JS9 display to one or more JS9 plugins using a
HTML data attribute <b>js9id</b>, specify the id of the main
JS9 display element as its value:
<pre>
    &lt;div class="JS9Menubar" data-js9id="myJS9"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="JS9" id="myJS9"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div style="margin-top: 2px;"&gt;
    &lt;div class="JS9Colorbar" data-js9id="myJS9"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
These two connection methods are equivalent. However, the <b>js9id</b>
data attribute method also allows you to specify the single-character
token <b>*</b> as a target value for many plugins. In this case, the
display associated with the plugin is dynamically selected by clicking
the mouse in a JS9 display window. In this way, a single plugin can serve
several displays.

<p>
The plugins that support dynamic selection are:
<ul>
<li> Blend
<li> Blink
<li> Colorbar
<li> Info
<li> Magnifier
<li> Menubar
<li> Panner
<li> Separate
<li> EncEnergy
<li> RadialProj
<li> Histogram
<li> RegionStats
<li> XProj
<li> YProj
<li> 3dPlot
</ul>

<p>
Note that ids are not required at all if there is only one JS9 instance on
the web page:
<pre>
    &lt;div class="JS9Menubar"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="JS9Toolbar"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="JS9"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div style="margin-top: 2px;"&gt;
    &lt;div class="JS9Colorbar"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
However, if your site needs to communicate with clients using
the <b>js9 script</b> for external communication, you can
differentiate between clients loading the same JS9-enabled web page by
supplying a unique ID when the JS9 page is served.

<p> A full example of how to define multiple instances of JS9 with ids
is found, for example, in the js9multi.html file. Two DS9 instances
are defined, having IDs of "JS9" (the default) and "myJS9". When
"myJS9" is the display ID, "myJS9Menubar" specifies the associated
menubar and "myJS9Console" specifies the associated console.

<p>
The js9.css file contains CSS directives for various parts of
JS9. These can be modified (or overwritten) as needed, subject to
ordinary CSS rules. In general, we recommend overwriting CSS rules by
loading a site-specific CSS file after the js9.css file. This makes
updating much easier.

<p>
One CSS directive worth noting is the <b>JS9Button</b> class, which
defines the look and feel of the buttons found on the Menubar, inside
plugins, etc.  The <b>JS9Button</b> class currently is set to
the <b>JS9ClassicButton</b> class, which mimics Mac OSX buttons in
shape and color. An alternative is the <b>JS9FlatButton</b> class
displays a flat blue button that highlights when the mouse hovers and
darkens when clicked. A <b>lightblue</b> background is often used with
this class of button. JS9 also defines a <b>JS9BorderButton</b> which
has a blue colored border and a white background.  The JS9 Menubar
supports two data properties to make it easier to change the button
and background:
<ul>
<li><b>buttonClass</b>: the class of button to use ("JS9ClassicButton", "JS9FlatButton", "JS9BorderButton" ... or your own class)
<li><b>backgroundColor</b>: color of background (default: "lightblue")
</ul>
The <a href="../js9sizes.html">JS9 Size Demo</a> displays different button styles.

<p>
Normally, JS9 will initialize itself automatically once the page is
loaded and ready: internally, jQuery $(document).ready() calls
<b>JS9.init()</b>. If you need to delay JS9 initialization (e.g., you
are using a platform that fires $(document).ready() before the
platform is really ready), you can set <b>data-js9init</b> to "false"
on any JS9 div. In this case, you must call the init routine manually:
<pre>
  JS9.init();
</pre>
Until you do this, no JS9 div elements will be visible.

<p>
When JS9 is fully loaded and ready (including connection to the JS9
helper, if necessary), it fires the <b>JS9:ready</b> event. You can
use this event to perform your own initialization:
<pre>
  $(document).on("JS9:ready", function(){
      myinit();
  });
</pre>

<p>
<h3>Menubar Styles</h3> The default menubar has a style in which all
of the major menus are shown at the top-level of the menubar. This is
the <b>classic</b> style. JS9 also supports a <b>mac</b> style
menubar, in which the <b>File</b>, <b>Edit</b> and <b>View</b> menus
are placed on the left side of the menubar and the <b>Help</b> menu on
the right.  The other main menus are displayed as sub-menus within
the <b>View</b> menu. The <b>mac</b> style can be specified in two
ways: you can set the JS9globalOpts.menubarStyle property to "mac" in
your js9prefs.js file to set the default menubar style for all menus
in the page. Alternatively you can supply a <b>data-style="mac"</b>
attribute to the Menubar div element:
<pre>
  &lt;div class="JS9Menubar" data-style="mac"&gt;
</pre>
This will set the menubar style for this element only.

<p>
<h3>Supermenus: One Menubar to Rule Them All</h3> By default, each
menubar controls one JS9 display. You can, however, create a menubar
that controls multiple displays, so that a given menu selection is
applied to each display (or to a specifically selected image). This is
done by creating a menubar div with two special characteristics:
<ul>
<li> the id of the menubar starts with <b>SUPERMENU_</b> (it can end with anything, or nothing)
<li> an HTML5 data attribute called <b>data-displays</b> lists the JS9 displays to control or "*" for all displays
</ul>
For example, to control two JS9 displays:
<pre>
  &lt;div class="JS9Menubar" id="SUPERMENU_" data-displays="JS9,myJS9"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
As shown, the <b>data-displays</b> attribute is a comma-separated list
of JS9 display ids to control with this super-menu.
<p>
A super-menu acts like an ordinary menu, except that it will control
all of the JS9 displays in the list. Thus, you can change multiple
colormaps at once, run analysis on all displays, etc.
<p>
You also can click on an individual display to make it the <b>selected
display</b> for the supermenu. The selected display will be
highlighted, and the supermenu will target its actions at this display
alone, rather than at all of the displays. Click again in a selected
display (or clicking in another display) to unselect it. In this way,
a single supermenu can be used to control several displays
individually (akin to how the top-level Apple menu functions with
regard to applications).
<p>
A supermenu displays an additional <b>Super</b> menu button on the
left side of the menubar. This button contains a list of all displays
controlled by the supermenu, with the selected display starred. You
can choose a new selected display from this menu, or choose "all
displays" to unselect.
<p>
Of course, you also can define a menubar for each display in order to
control them individually. Since the actions of an ordinary menu and a
super-menu can be mixed for a given JS9 display, the displays will not
always be perfectly synchronized. In such a case, the super-menu's
selected values will be tied to the first display in the
<b>data-displays</b> list.  For example, if the first display listed
is at zoom 2 and the second is at zoom 4, the Zoom menu will show
a current zoom value of 2.

<p>
<h3>Adding Server-side Analysis Tasks to Your Web Page</h3>
<p>
Server-side JS9 analysis tasks can be executed using
the <b>Analysis</b> menu, but they also can be executed directly from
the web page using HTML elements (buttons, forms, etc.) To do this, a
web page author simply creates the web interface and calls
either <b>JS9.RunAnalysis()</b> (for buttons, menus, etc.)
or <b>JS9.SubmitAnalysis()</b> (for forms). These are described
in the <a href="localtasks.html">Local Tasks</a> web page.

<p>
<h3>Adding Local Analysis Tasks to Your Web Page</h3>
<p>
JS9 also supports the ability to perform local analysis, i.e.,
analysis tasks defined and executed right on your web page, rather
than being executed by a back-end server.  This is accomplished by
offering access to the image data and region information via
a <b>public JS9 API</b>. See the
<a href="localtasks.html">Local Tasks</a> for more information.

<p>
<h3>Adding JS9 Display Windows Dynamically</h3>
<p>
JS9 display windows can be created dynamically using the JS9 Public API call
<b>JS9.LoadWindow()</b>. You can create a light window to hold a new
JS9 display on the same page or you can create an entirely separate
pop-up window. See the
<a href="publicapi.html">JS9 Public API</a> for more information.

<p>
<h3>Adding Data Files to a Web Page</h3>
<p>
Data file links are added to a web page by supplying URLs that call
the <b>JS9.Load()</b> routine.
You also can load images automatically when the web page loads using the
<b>JS9.Preload()</b> routine.
See:
<a href="yourdata.html">Adding Data Files To a Web Page</a> for more
information.
