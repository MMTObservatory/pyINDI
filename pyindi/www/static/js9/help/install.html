<center><h3>Installing JS9</h3></center>

<h3>Summary for the Impatient</h3>
<ul>
<li> retrieve and unpack the source code tar file or clone the js9 repository
<li> JS9 is now ready for drag-and-drop image files using the file:// URI
<li> run "./mkjs9 -q" to set up the js9 command-line script in its simplest form
<li> to install JS9 into a web server tree, run configure with this switch:
<pre>
  # location to install the JS9 web files:
  ./configure --with-webdir=[path_to_web_install]
</pre>
<li> to add large file support, build the helper with these switches:
<pre>
  # where to find cfitsio and install binaries, what sort of helper to build:
  ./configure  --with-cfitsio=[path_to_cfitsio] --prefix=[path_to_prog_install] --with-helper=nodejs
</pre>
<li> edit the js9prefs.js to set up your site-specific JS9 parameters
<li> build, install, clean up: <b>make; make install; make clean</b>
</ul>

<h3>Retrieve and Unpack the Source Code Tar File</h3>
<p>
The current release of the JS9 source tar file is available at:
<pre>
    https://js9.si.edu
</pre>
The source tar file will unpack into a js9-[version] directory with
the usual tar command, e.g:
<pre>
    tar xfz js9-[version].tar.gz
</pre>
The most up to date version of JS9 is available on GitHub:
<pre>
    git clone https://github.com/ericmandel/js9
</pre>
The GitHub version will contain the latest bug fixes and improvements.
Once you have cloned JS9, you can retrieve the latest update:
<pre>
    git pull
</pre>
Note that the main JS9 web site runs the latest software from GitHub.

<h3>Run JS9 using the file:// URI</h3>
After the source code is retrieved, you should be able to load any of the
js9*.html web pages into your browser using the file:// URI. For
example, if you unpacked the tar file into /Users/me on a Mac, then
you can point your browser to:
<pre>
    file:///Users/me/js9-[version]/js9basics.html
</pre>
to see the basic JS9 demo page. You then can drag any FITS image file onto
the JS9 display and view it, change contrast/bias, colormaps,
scale, create regions, etc. Furthermore, if you load the imexam web page:
<pre>
    file:///Users/me/js9-[version]/js9imexam.html
</pre>
you can move a region around and run browser-based analysis as
the region changes.
<p>
NB: The file://URI does not work in Google Chrome: Chrome doesn't
permit a local HTML file to read other local files. The workaround is
to start Chrome with the --allow-file-access-from-files switch:
<pre>
    # Linux:
    chrome --allow-file-access-from-files
    # Mac:
    open /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --args --allow-file-access-from-files
</pre>
Firefox and Safari do not have this restriction.
<p>
If you just want to run JS9 in this simple way, you are done. However,
you might want to edit the js9prefs.js file to set up default values
for colormaps, scaling, etc. See:
<a href="./preferences.html">JS9 Site Preferences</a> for a
description of the available parameters.

<h3>Do You Want to Run JS9 as a Desktop Program from the Command Line?</h3>
JS9 can be used as a desktop replacement for SAOimage DS9: you can
load images into the app's (Chrome) web page (or your own custom web
page) instead of a browser, and use the full power of JS9, including
external messaging.

<p>
Running JS9 on the desktop simply requires that you install
<a href="http://electron.atom.io">Electron.js</a>, an app building
platform that combines Node.js and the Chrome libraries.  To install
Electron, go to the release page:
<a href="http://electron.atom.io/releases/">
http://electron.atom.io/releases</a>, choose the latest available
stable release, and download the zip file for your platform.  On a
Mac, Electron.app should be installed in the /Applications or
~/Applications folder. On Linux, the electron program should be placed
in your PATH. Note that Electron requires a relatively recent version
of Linux: Ubuntu 12.04, Fedora 21, Debian 8, CentOS 7 (not CentOS 6).

<p>
Once the Electron app is installed, generate the JS9 quick-start files:
<pre>
  ./mkjs9 -q
  Editing js9Prefs.json for Node.js helper ...
  Editing js9prefs.js for Node.js helper ...
  Generating js9 script for JS9 messaging and desktop use ...

  If you plan to use Electron.app with JS9, consider codesign'ing it:

  sudo codesign --force --deep --sign - /Applications/Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron/

  This will avoid repeated requests to allow incoming connections.
</pre>
The mkjs9 script will create a js9prefs.js file (for the browser) and
a js9Prefs.json file (for the JS9 helper), which you can edit to add
preferred JS9 properties, as well as a js9 script to start the JS9
app. On a Mac, you probably will want to codesign the Electron.app
application to avoid repeated requests about incoming connections (see
example above).

<p>
Run the js9 script to start the app and load data files:
<pre>
  # the -a switch tells the script to bring up the desktop js9 app
  js9 -a ~/data/casa.fits &
</pre>
and then use the same script to interact with the JS9 page (or any
other JS9-enabled web page):
<pre>
  # without -a, the script sends commands to the JS9 display
  js9 cmap cool
  js9 regions circle
</pre>

<p>
For more details, see: <a href="desktop.html">Desktop JS9</a>.

<h3>Do You Want to Install JS9 in a Web Server?</h3>  
If you want to run JS9 in a "real" web server, build and install
the JS9 tools and files using the standard GNU procedure:
<pre>
  ./configure <b>--with-webdir=[path]</b> ... other switches ...
  make
  make install
</pre>
At a minimum, you should run configure with the <b>--with-webdir=[path]</b>
switch, which specifies the directory into which the JS9 web files
(JavaScript, CSS, etc.) will be installed.  We recommend that this
directory only contain the installed JS9 files, i.e. that you install
JS9 into its own self-contained directory. This will make upgrading to
new versions much easier.

<p>
Furthermore, we recommend that you not split up the JS9 files or
install them outside the JS9 install directory. Not only is this
difficult to update, but it actually will break JS9: at runtime, it is
assumed that js9.css is located in the JS9 install directory, and its
actual location is used to determine the JS9 install location relative
to the main web page. If you must move the js9.css file, you will also
need to add the <b>installDir</b> property to the <b>globalOpts</b>
object within js9prefs.js, specifying the relative path from the web
page to the JS9 install directory. Failure to do this correctly will
cause a host of problems, starting with JS9 not loading astroem.js and
js9worker.js.  Please contact us if you have problems (the first
indication of which probably will be JavaScript error messages when
failing to load astroem.js and js9worker.js.)

<p>
As described in <a href="./webpage.html">Creating a JS9 Web Page</a>,
a few JavaScript and CSS files must be loaded into a JS9-enabled web page.
Ordinarily this is done in the page's header, which typically will
look something like this:
<pre>
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"&gt;
  &lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=Edge;chrome=1" &gt;
  &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" &gt;
  &lt;link type="image/x-icon" rel="shortcut icon" href="./favicon.ico"&gt;
  &lt;link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="js9support.css"&gt;
  &lt;link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="js9.css"&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="js9prefs.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="js9support.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="js9.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="js9plugins.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
</pre>
Also during startup, JS9 will asynchronously load
the <b>js9worker.js</b> file in order to create a worker process and
will load either the <b>astroem.js</b> file or the <b>astroemw.js</b>
and <b>astroemw.wasm</b> files, depending on whether
<a href="http://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> is supported on your browser.

<p>
Although none of these files are large, it always is worthwhile making
downloaded files smaller to shorten the web page load time.  One
straight-forward way to do this, if you have control of the Apache web
server, is to use the Apache rewrite capability to serve gzip'ed files
in place of requested (uncompressed) files, if the former exist. Using
this technique, your header can remain as shown above, but the Apache
server will send gzip'ed versions when available. To do this, you can
add code such as the following to the Apache httpd.conf:
<pre>
  &lt;IfModule mod_headers.c&gt;
    # turn on rewrite
    RewriteEngine on

    # Serve gzip compressed CSS files if they exist
    # and the client accepts gzip.
    RewriteCond "%{HTTP:Accept-encoding}" "gzip"
    RewriteCond "%{REQUEST_FILENAME}\.gz" -s
    RewriteRule "^(.*)\.css" "$1\.css\.gz" [QSA]

    # Serve gzip compressed JS files if they exist
    # and the client accepts gzip.
    RewriteCond "%{HTTP:Accept-encoding}" "gzip"
    RewriteCond "%{REQUEST_FILENAME}\.gz" -s
    RewriteRule "^(.*)\.js" "$1\.js\.gz" [QSA]

    # Serve gzip compressed wasm files if they exist
    # and the client accepts gzip.
    RewriteCond "%{HTTP:Accept-encoding}" "gzip"
    RewriteCond "%{REQUEST_FILENAME}\.gz" -s
    RewriteRule "^(.*)\.wasm" "$1\.wasm\.gz" [QSA]

    # Serve correct content types, and prevent mod_deflate double gzip.
    RewriteRule "\.css\.gz$" "-" [T=text/css,E=no-gzip:1]
    RewriteRule "\.js\.gz$" "-" [T=text/javascript,E=no-gzip:1]
    RewriteRule "\.wasm\.gz$" "-" [T=application/octet-stream,E=no-gzip:1]

    &lt;FilesMatch "(\.js\.gz|\.css\.gz|\.wasm\.gz)$"&gt;
    # Serve correct encoding type.
    Header append Content-Encoding gzip
    # Force proxies to cache gzipped &
    # non-gzipped css/js files separately.
    Header append Vary Accept-Encoding
    &lt;/FilesMatch&gt;
  &lt;/IfModule&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Note that the JS9 Makefile contains a rule called <b>install-gzip</b> which
will install gzip'ed copies of several JS9 files along side the uncompressed
versions:
<pre>
  ./configure ...
  make
  make install
  make install-gzip
</pre>

<h3>Do You Want to Configure Server-side Analysis or External Messaging?</h3>
<p>
JS9 supports server-side ("back-end") analysis on FITS data using a
server-side helper. This capability allows you to execute virtually
any command-line analysis program from JS9. The analysis command is
run on the back-end server and results viewed on your web page.  You can
utilize your own web server as the JS9 back-end helper using CGI
calls, or you can run a separate Node.js-based server to process JS9
back-end requests.  The server-side analysis capability is especially
useful for archive centers, but also can be attractive to individual
users who want to integrate their own data analysis programs into JS9.
<p>
In addition, JS9 supports
<a href="./extmsg.html">command-line messaging</a>
between the shell and JS9,
<a href="./python.html">pyjs9 Python messaging</a>
between the Python and JS9,
and also has large-file support via the use of 
<a href="./repfile.html">representation files</a>.
These capabilities requires the configuration of a
Node.js-based server-side helper.
<p>
You configure a JS9 helper by adding additional switches to
the configure command, e.g.:
<pre>
  # where to find cfitsio and install binaries, what sort of helper to build:
  ./configure  --with-cfitsio=[path_to_cfitsio] --prefix=$HOME --with-helper=nod
  make
  make install
</pre>
See:
<a href="./helper.html">Installing a Server-side Helper</a>
for details.

<h3>Build the JS9 System</h3>
Once you have decided on the configuration of your JS9 system, run
<b>configure</b> to generate various build files:
<pre>
  ./configure [your JS9 switches]
</pre>
<p>
and then build the JS9 system using the <b>make</b> command:
<pre>
   make
</pre>
Minor note: the cloned js9 script will be modified by the build to
include knowledge of the source and install directories. This change
allows you to run using the installed code instead of the source code.
But since this modification will prevent subsequent "git pull"
calls from completing, it will be reset by install or clean.

<h3>Finalize Your Site Preferences</h3>
<p>
The js9prefs.js file and js9Prefs.json file contain various default
settings for JS9, e.g. default colormap and scale for image display.
Feel free to edit this file to set up your own site-specific
parameters. See
<a href="./preferences.html">JS9 Site Preferences</a> for a
description of the available parameters.

<h3>Install the JS9 System</h3>
<p> When the build is completed, you can install the JS9 into your web tree:
<pre>
    make install
</pre>
<p>
The first time you install JS9, your preference files will also be
installed. After that, the install command will not install these
files in order to avoid overwriting custom files. You can explicitly
re-install preference files using:
<pre>
    make install-prefs
</pre>
or simply copy them into the install directory.

Clean up the build directory using the command:
<pre>
    make clean
</pre>
<h3>Optionally Install the JS9 Test Data Files</h3>
<p> 
If you want to display our test data files in the JS9 demo pages, 
you must retrieve the JS9 data file tar file from the JS9 web site:
<pre>
    https://js9.si.edu
</pre>
and untar it into the JS9 web install directory. This will create
sub-directories containing the image data. These data files also are
available on GitHub:
<pre>
    https://github.com/ericmandel/js9data
</pre>
