<center><h3>Dealing with Memory Limitations</h3></center>

<p>
Desktop application developers count on a semi-infinite amount of
memory for applications.  This is a luxury not afforded to browser
application developers. Browsers have two memory-related issues that
must kept in mind when developing applications:
<ul>
<li> browsers often impose per-tab memory limitations
<li> browser memory is managed automatically by garbage collection
(GC) algorithms
</ul>

<center><h3>Per-tab memory limits</h3></center>

Browser limitations on per-tab memory are not well documented.  The
64-bit Chrome browsers are known to have a 4Gb per-tab memory limit.
iOS devices have more stringent limitations:
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6044147/ios-memory-allocation-how-much-memory-can-be-used-in-an-application">empirical evidence</a> indicates that the iPhone 6 is limited to 645Mb, the
iPhone 6s to 1Gb, and the iPhone 7 to 2Gb.

<p>
To better deal with memory limits, JS9 offers a number of global
parameters in the <b>JS9.globalOpts</b> object. New values for these
parameters can be added to the JS9 preference file. (See
<a href="preferences.html">Configuring JS9 Site Preferences</a>
for more information about preferences.)

The <b>JS9.globalOpts.maxMemory</b> parameter specifies the largest
array size (in bytes) that can be allocated in the heap to hold a FITS
image. The default is currently set to 750000000 (i.e., 750Mb). It is
automatically set to lower values for Chrome (500000000 or 500Mb) and
mobile (300000000).

<p>
Similarly, the <b>JS9.globalOpts.image</b> object allows you to set
the max size image section that will be created from a FITS image.
The general default values are {x: 0, y: 0}, where 0 values specify
unlimited section size.  For Chrome, the limits are set to {x: 6144,
y: 6144} while for mobile devices, they are set to {x: 4096, y:
4096}. Obviously, these are just empirical guesses on our part!

<p>
When a FITS files is displayed by JS9, the file itself is maintained in memory,
which is useful in many cases:
<ul>
<li> displaying multi-extension FITS files (use the Extensions plugin
to switch between extensions)
<li> displaying data cubes (use the Data Cube plugin to display a different
slice of the image)
<li> binning and filtering X-ray binary tables (use the Binning/Filtering
plugin for binning and filtering)
<li> performing wcs reprojections, including image rotation
</ul>
If none of the above apply to your use of JS9, you can save memory by
removing the virtual FITS file. This can be done manually by choosing
the <b>File -> free image memory</b> option.

<p>
Alternatively, the <b>JS9.globalOpts.clearImageMemory</b> parameter
can be used to specify when JS9 should automatically remove the FITS
virtual file after displaying each image. Options include:
<ul>
<li><b>never</b>: no automatic removal of the virtual FITS file (default)
<li><b>always</b>: always remove the virtual FITS file
<li><b>auto</b>: remove the virtual file if the displayed image is a 2D image (not a table or cube) and there are no other HDU extensions
<li><b>noExt</b>: remove the virtual file if there are no other HDU extensions
<li><b>noCube</b>: remove the file is the displayed image is not a cube
<li><b>size,[x]</b>: remove the file is its size is greater than [x] Mb
</ul>

<center><h3>Garbage collection</h3></center>

<p>
In the early days of desktop programming, memory was allocated and
freed explicitly. This allowed fine-grained control over the amount of
memory being used at any one time, but often led to memory leaks if
the developer forgot to free previously allocated memory.

<p>
Modern languages, including Javascript, use automatic techniques such as
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Memory_Management">garbage collection</a> (GC) to manage memory. In principle, memory gets
freed when it is "no longer needed". But since the concept of "no
longer needed" cannot be decided unambiguously, approximate algorithms
are used.

<p>
Problems then arise because these garbage collection algorithms are only
run periodically and they do not always identify all of the memory
objects that can be freed.  Developers often supply "hints" to the
garbage collector by setting object to null or deleting large
properties of an object.

<p>
Because JS9 deals with large chunks of data, garbage collection delays
and misses can lead to larger than expected memory utilization. In May
2017, we found that continuously loading and closing an image was not
freeing memory properly. The problem was traced to two different
factors.  First, especially in Chrome, the garbage
collector was not properly sensing that the fileReader result memory
was available for clearing. To remedy the situation, we had to delete
the fileReader result object explicitly:
<pre>
  fileReader = new FileReader();
  fileReader.onload(function(){
    ... do work on the fileReader.result array ...
    // give the garbage collector a hint that we're done with the array
    delete fileReader.result;
  });
  // start reading the file as a an array
  fileReader.readAsArrayBuffer(fits);
</pre>
See
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32102361/filereader-memory-leak">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32102361/filereader-memory-leak</a> for discussion of a similar problem.

<p>
Second, we found that if a continuous Javascript loop was too tight,
the GC might not be run. This was especially true of Firefox. In the
example below, each LoadFITS() call is making an xhr() call to check
status of a FITS file, and loading the file using JS9.Load() if necessary.
Since JS9.Load() runs asynchronously, there never was enough
idle time to start the GC, and memory was not released properly. This
situation actually could be seen using the Performance tab in the
Firefox Developer Tools: the GC was run at the start of the loop, but
never run again:
<pre>
  var timeout = 1000;
  setInterval(function() {
    LoadFITS("foo1");
    LoadFITS("foo2");
  }, timeout);
</pre>
<p>
As a remedy, we used a longer timeout and also skipped processing for
a few several cycles over time, to try to ensure that the browser had enough
idle time to start the GC.
<pre>
  var nloop = 0;
  var modcycle = 1;
  var loopcycle = 10;
  var timeout = 3000;
  setInterval(function() {
    nloop++;
    nmod = nloop % loopcycle;
    // skip modcycle loops to give the GC time to be run
    if( nmod &gt; modcycle ) {
      LoadFITS("foo1");
      LoadFITS("foo2");
    }
    // timeout should be long enough to give the GC time to be run
  }, timeout);
</pre>
<p>
Another possible remedy is to reload the page periodically in order to
reset browser memory:
<pre>
  var nloop = 0;
  var modcycle = 1;
  var loopcycle = 10;
  var timeout = 3000;
  var maxloop = 1800 * 1000 / timeout;
  setInterval(function() {
    nloop++;
    nmod = nloop % loopcycle;
    // reload page, approx every half hour
    if( nloop &gt; maxloop ){
        window.location.href = window.location.href;
    }
    // skip modcycle loops to give the GC time to be run
    if( nmod &gt; modcycle ) {
      LoadFITS("foo1");
      LoadFITS("foo2");
    }
    // timeout should be long enough to give the GC time to be run
  }, timeout);
</pre>
<p>
If you find that JS9 is taking much more memory than you expect,
especially in situations where images are being loaded in a loop
please let us know and we will try to help diagnose the problem. Note
that Chrome and Firefox Memory both have Memory and Performance
utilities in their Developer Tools that are very useful in
understanding memory allocation issues.

<p>
Alternatively, in situations where loading images in a loop is
utilizing more memory than expected, you might consider embedding JS9
inside an iframe in your web page, and reloading the JS9 page
periodically. This should prevent garbage collection-related memory
problems, because memory is reset each time the page is loaded.
